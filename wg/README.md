### Elaborated Agenda

0. Reminder everything should mesh with [the main pangeo site](http://pangeo.io/)
1. Roll call: Name, where, focus
    - Rob: Remarks on inclusivity and Sir Not Appearing In This Call
2. Recap the three pillars of pangeo
    - The Pangeo project serves as a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure 
      - Community building: Foster collaboration around open source scientific Python ecosystem for O/A/L/CS
      - Domain tool-building: Support development of domain-specific geoscience packages
      - Scale-tech building: Improve scalability of these tools, i.e. operate on large datasets
3. Recap of "input to date" on pangeo education
    - facets
      - Practical considerations
        - To work on this requires support of some sort; what is pending? what might we apply for?
          - Example (past): [NSF 19-524](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=505342&ods_key=nsf19524)
        - "Thanks for the pod... by the way who pays for this?"
        - Schedule: Year 2 (NASA) starts in August; many other gears also turning
        - What are the different ways that pangeo education goes into practice? (list courses, hackweeks, etc)
        - Meetings
          - Joe report on France meeting
          - August meeting is pending
          - pangeo could/should spin up its own hackweek: Discuss
          - pangeo could/should spin up its own week-long conference (say summer 2020): Discuss.
        - What does a community build look like? 
          - Bring in more scientists; so what is in it for them?
          - Bring in more developers; so what is in it for them?
          - How does publishing domain code create positive feedback?
      - method and philosophy
        - "A cascade of education materials" (similar size, smaller quanta composable units)
          - modularized from a 20 minute talk to a 4 hour AGU tutorial to multi-day presence at hackweek 
        - 5 or 6 virtual sprints per year
        - Virtual working space
        - Need a ***testing protocol and testing schedule*** for content
        - Pedagogical issues: Expert blind spot, ***debugging***, time-to-proficiency estimation, what else?
      - Existing content
        - Damien's OA s/w carpentry (Example review question: 'Does this include `dask`?')
        - Need a review/overhaul of the table presented on the 
[*education-material* repo main page](https://github.com/pangeo-data/education-material)
        - Z2JHub: Good exemplar project model for content
          - Z2Pangeo is nice but too general; suggesting Z2PangeoX where X is the focus
      - Synthesis and Wheel Non-Reinvention
        - Let's consider R-OpenSci and Pi-OpenSci: Peer review s/w publication
        - Z2Pangeo >> Z2JHub???
        - "Focus on building better documentation elsewhere" not just += the pangeo portfolio (tag!)
        - Align with NCAR's ongoing efforts, NCL transition, etc?
4. Open discussion: What else should be in the mix
5. Call tempo through August
6. Actions
  - Write up notes from this call (Rob)
  - Schedule next call
  - Create working space
  - Draft a ***Game Plan***:  Participants with roles, deliverables; sprint timing (first one to end Aug 16?)
  - Issue #521 at pangeo-data/pangeo: Glacier model proposal by fmaussion: Follow-up?
  - Issue #440 at pangeo-data/pangeo: Resources for education events: We need an owner for this sub-topic (especially load testing)
  - Issues #411 and #575 require review with follow-up with contributors >> Game Plan
