### Elaborated Agenda

0. Reminder everything should mesh with [the main pangeo site](http://pangeo.io/)
1. Roll call: Name, where, focus
    - Rob: Remarks on inclusivity and Sir Not Appearing In This Call
2. Recap the three pillars of pangeo
    - The Pangeo project serves as a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure 
      - Community building: Foster collaboration around open source scientific Python ecosystem for O/A/L/CS
      - Domain tool-building: Support development of domain-specific geoscience packages
      - Scale-tech building: Improve scalability of these tools, i.e. operate on large datasets
3. Recap of "input to date" on pangeo education
    - facets
      - Practical considerations
        - To work on this requires support of some sort; what is pending? what might we apply for?
        - "Thanks for the pod... by the way who pays for this?"
        - Schedule: Year 2 (NASA) starts in August; many other gears also turning
        - What are the different ways that pangeo education goes into practice? (list courses, hackweeks, etc)
        - Meetings
          - Joe report on France meeting
          - August meeting is pending
          - pangeo could/should spin up its own hackweek: Discuss
          - pangeo could/should spin up its own week-long conference (say summer 2020): Discuss.
        - What does a community build look like? 
          - Bring in more scientists; so what is in it for them?
          - Bring in more developers; so what is in it for them?
          - How does publishing domain code create positive feedback?
      - method and philosophy
        - "A cascade of education materials" (similar size, smaller quanta composable units)
          - modularized from a 20 minute talk to a 4 hour AGU tutorial to multi-day presence at hackweek 
        - 5 or 6 virtual sprints per year
        - Virtual working space
        - Need a testing protocol and testing schedule for content
        - Pedagogical issues: Expert blind spot, debugging, time-to-proficiency estimation, what else?
      - Existing content
        - Let's consider R-OpenSci and Pi-OpenSci: Peer review s/w publication
        - Damien's OA s/w carpentry (Joe asks whether this includes `dask`)
        - Z2JHub: Good exemplar project model for content
          - Z2Pangeo is nice but too general; suggesting Z2PangeoX where X is the focus
      - Wheel Non-Reinvention
        - Let's consider R-OpenSci and Pi-OpenSci: Peer review s/w publication
        - Z2Pangeo >> Z2JHub???
        - "Focus on building better documentation elsewhere" not just += the pangeo portfolio (tag!)
4. Open discussion: What should be in the mix
5. Call tempo through September
6. Actions
  - Write up notes from this call (Rob)
  - Schedule next call
  - Define working space
  - Draft the game plan
